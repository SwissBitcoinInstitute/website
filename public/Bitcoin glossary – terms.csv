Ordinals;?;;;
OTC;?;;;
Proof of Stake (POS);?;AI written;Proof of Stake is a consensus mechanism where block creation rights are assigned based on ownership of the native asset, rather than computational work. Unlike Proof-of-Work, PoS lacks an external cost anchor, making it vulnerable to different security trade-offs.;
RGB Protocol;?;;;
Runes Protocol;?;;;
Shitcoin;?;AI written;Shitcoin is a derogatory term for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, implying they lack sound monetary properties or meaningful utility. From a Bitcoin maximalist perspective, all altcoins fall under this category due to inferior security or centralization.;
Smart Contract;?;human written;Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on a blockchain and automatically enforce the terms of an agreement when predefined conditions are met. In Bitcoin, smart contracts are implemented via the scripting system. Unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin contracts are deliberately limited to enhance security and robustness.;
Supply;?;;;
Tether;?;;;

Zero Knowledge Proof;?;AI written;A zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic technique allowing one party to prove knowledge of a statement without revealing the statement itself. While not part of Bitcoin’s base protocol, zero-knowledge proofs are explored in other cryptocurrencies for privacy enhancements.;
Adress;good to go;human written;A Bitcoin address is an identifier used to receive bitcoin. It is derived from a public key, which in turn is derived from a private key. Bitcoin sent to an address can only be spent by someone who controls the corresponding private key. A wallet consists of one or more Bitcoin addresses and their associated keys. Common address formats include Base58Check (legacy), Bech32 (SegWit), and Bech32m (Taproot), each reflecting different script types.;
Altcoin;good to go;human written;An altcoin (alternative coin) is any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin.;
AML – Anti-Money Laundering;good to go;human written;Anti-Money Laundering (AML) refers to a set of laws, regulations, and procedures designed to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate. Financial institutions, including cryptocurrency exchanges, are required to implement AML measures such as customer identification, transaction monitoring, and reporting of suspicious activity. While AML frameworks aim to reduce financial crime and promote transparency, they also limit privacy and can reduce financial sovereignty for users.;
ASIC – Application Specific Integrated Circuit;good to go;human written;An ASIC is a hardware circuit built for a single computational task. In mining, ASICs are optimized exclusively for SHA-256 hashing, making them vastly more efficient than CPUs, GPUs, or FPGAs. Their introduction professionalized mining and concentrated it in industrial-scale facilities.;
Austrian School of Economics;good to go;human written;The Austrian School of Economics is a school of thought emphasizing individual decision-making, sound money, and skepticism toward central planning. Its insights on monetary policy and inflation underpin much of the ideological support for Bitcoin as a form of digital hard money.;
Base Layer;good to go;human written;The base layer refers to the main Bitcoin blockchain, where transactions are settled and secured by Proof-of-Work. Higher-layer protocols such as the Lightning Network extend its functionality but rely on the base layer for final settlement and security guarantees.;
Batching;good to go;human written;Batching is the practice of combining multiple payment outputs into a single transaction. This reduces overall data size on the blockchain and lowers transaction fees. Exchanges and high-volume senders often use batching to improve efficiency and scalability.;
Bit Gold;good to go;human written;Bit gold was a digital currency design proposed by Nick Szabo in 1998. It outlined a system combining reusable Proof-of-Work and distributed timestamping to create scarce digital assets. Although never implemented, it directly influenced the creation of Bitcoin.;
Bitcoin;good to go;human written;Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency and peer-to-peer payment network secured by Proof-of-Work. It records transactions in a public blockchain, maintained by independently validating nodes. Bitcoin has a fixed monetary supply of 21 million coins, enforced by consensus rules. Its design eliminates the need for intermediaries, combining digital scarcity with censorship resistance and global accessibility.;
Bitcoin ATM;good to go;human written;A Bitcoin ATM is a physical kiosk that allows users to buy or sell Bitcoin using cash or electronic payments. Depending on the machine, users can deposit fiat currency to receive Bitcoin or sell Bitcoin for fiat withdrawal. These ATMs often charge higher fees than online exchanges but provide local accessibility.;
Bitcoin Cash;good to go;human written;Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that originated from a hard fork of Bitcoin in August 2017. The fork was driven by disagreements within the Bitcoin community over scalability, particularly whether to increase the block size to allow more transactions per block (this debate is known as the Blocksize War). Bitcoin Cash increased the block size limit to prioritize on-chain transaction throughput, resulting in a separate blockchain and cryptocurrency distinct from Bitcoin. Today, Bitcoin Cash is significantly smaller in terms of network security, adoption, and economic activity and is largely irrelevant in size compared to Bitcoin.;
Bitcoin Dominance;good to go;human written;Bitcoin dominance is the percentage of Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to that of all cryptocurrencies combined. It is often cited as a measure of Bitcoin’s strength or investor confidence compared to altcoins.;
Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP);good to go;human written;A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is a formal document suggesting technical or informational changes to the Bitcoin protocol. BIPs provide a structured way for developers, researchers, and the community to propose, discuss, and document improvements before they are implemented. They cover a wide range of topics, including consensus rules, transaction formats, wallet standards, and best practices;
Bitcoin Maximalism;good to go;human written;Bitcoin maximalism is the belief that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that will maintain long-term relevance. Advocates argue that Bitcoin’s decentralization, security, and scarcity make other altcoins redundant or inferior.;
Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (Bitcoin SV);good to go;human written;Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (Bitcoin SV) is a cryptocurrency that split from Bitcoin Cash in 2018 via a hard fork. It aims to implement what it claims is Satoshi Nakamoto’s “original vision” by enabling unbounded block sizes and on-chain scaling. Critics argue that such design compromises decentralization and security. Today Bitcoin SV it is much smaller in terms of adoption, network security, and economic activity compared to Bitcoin.;
Block Size;good to go;human written;Block size refers to the maximum data capacity of a block. In Bitcoin, blocks are measured in weight units, with a maximum size of 4 million weight units following the adoption of SegWit. Block size is a fundamental parameter that balances transaction capacity with decentralization and security.;
Blockchain Explorer;good to go;human written;A blockchain explorer is a tool for inspecting the contents of the blockchain. It allows users to search for blocks, transactions, and addresses, and to monitor confirmations and balances derived from the UTXO set. A populer blockchain explorer for Bitcoin is mempool.space.;
Blocksize War;good to go;human written;The Blocksize War refers to the prolonged debate and conflict within the Bitcoin community, roughly between 2015 and 2017, over how to scale the Bitcoin network. The core disagreement centered on whether to increase the block size limit to allow more on-chain transactions or to prioritize decentralization and implement scaling solutions such as Segregated Witness (SegWit) and second-layer protocols. The conflict resulted in deep community divisions and ultimately led to hard forks such as Bitcoin Cash, while Bitcoin retained smaller blocks and adopted off-chain scaling approaches.;
BTC;good to go;human written;BTC is the commonly used ticker symbol for bitcoin, the native currency of the Bitcoin network. One BTC is divisible into 100 million satoshis, the smallest unit recognized by the protocol.;
CBDC - Central Bank Digital Currency;good to go;human written;A central bank digital currency (CBDC) is a digital form of a country’s fiat currency issued and controlled by a central bank. Unlike Bitcoin, CBDCs are centralized, permissioned systems that allow issuing authorities to monitor, control, and potentially restrict transactions.;
Checksum;good to go;human written;A checksum is a short sequence of bits added to data to detect errors or alterations. It is derived from the original data using a cryptographic hash function and appended so that any change in the data, such as a mistyped character in a Bitcoin address or seed phrase, will result in an invalid checksum. This allows software to immediately detect mistakes or tampering, preventing Bitcoin from being sent to an incorrect or non-existent address.;
Cloud Mining;good to go;human written;Cloud mining is the practice of renting hashrate from a remote data center to participate in mining. Users pay a fee to access external hardware rather than running devices themselves. It often exposes participants to counterparty risk and has been associated with scams.;
CoinJoin;good to go;human written;CoinJoin is a privacy technique that aggregates multiple users’ transactions into a single transaction. By mixing inputs and outputs, it obscures which coins belong to which participant.;
Cold Wallet;good to go;human written;A cold wallet is a storage method where private keys are kept offline, disconnected from the internet. Examples include hardware wallets, paper wallets, and air-gapped devices. Cold wallets reduce exposure to online attacks and are suitable for long-term storage of significant amounts of bitcoin.;
Confirmation;good to go;human written;A confirmation is the process by which a Bitcoin transaction is included in a block on the blockchain and recognized as valid by the network. Each additional block added on top of the block containing the transaction counts as one more confirmation, increasing the security and finality of the transaction. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it becomes to reverse, making it increasingly secure against double-spending.;
Custodial Wallet;good to go;human written;A custodial wallet is a wallet in which a third party controls the user’s private keys. Exchanges and hosted wallet providers commonly offer custodial wallets. They provide convenience but reintroduce counterparty risk, violating the principle “not your keys, not your coins.”;
Cypherpunk;good to go;human written;A cypherpunk is a member of a movement advocating the use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies as tools for social and political change. Bitcoin emerged from the cypherpunk tradition, combining digital cash concepts with decentralized consensus.;
Doublespend / Doublespending Problem;good to go;human written;The double spending problem refers to the risk that a digital token could be spent more than once. Bitcoin solves this problem by recording transactions in a public blockchain secured by Proof-of-Work, making past entries computationally infeasible to reverse.;
ECDSA – Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm;good to go;human written;ECDSA is a cryptographic algorithm used in Bitcoin to create digital signatures. It allows a user to prove ownership of a private key by generating a signature that can be verified with the corresponding public key, without revealing the private key itself. Bitcoin uses the secp256k1 elliptic curve for ECDSA.;
Fiat Currency;good to go;human written;A fiat currency is money issued by a state and declared legal tender, without backing by a commodity like gold or silver. Its name comes from the Latin word fiat, meaning “there shall be,” reflecting that the currency has value because the government decrees it. Unlike Bitcoin, its supply is controlled by central banks and can be expanded arbitrarily. Examples include the US dollar, euro, and yen.;
Fork;good to go;human written;A fork in Bitcoin is an event where the blockchain diverges into two separate paths, typically due to differences in software rules or consensus among nodes. Forks can be soft forks, which are backward-compatible changes that tighten or modify rules without splitting the network, or hard forks, which introduce incompatible changes that create a new blockchain if some nodes do not upgrade. Forks can occur for protocol upgrades, feature additions, or community disagreements, and they play a key role in the evolution and governance of the Bitcoin network.;
Fractional Reserve Banking;good to go;human written;Fractional reserve banking is a banking system in which banks keep only a fraction of customer deposits as reserves and lend out the remainder. This practice allows banks to create money through lending, increasing the effective money supply in the economy. Fractional reserve banking is the dominant banking model in most modern economies today. Associated risks of fractional reserved banking are increased leverage, systemic fragility, and the potential for bank runs if confidence is lost.;
Gold Standard;good to go;human written;The gold standard is a monetary system in which a country’s currency is directly linked to a fixed quantity of gold. Under this system, paper money could be exchanged for gold at a set rate, helping ensure that the currency retained long-term stability and purchasing power. The gold standard was widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but most countries gradually abandoned it. Gold convertibility was first suspended during wartime, and later most countries fully moved to fiat currency systems, notably after the US ended the dollar’s direct convertibility to gold in 1971.;
Hard Fork;good to go;human written;A hard fork is a consensus rule change that is not backward-compatible. Nodes that do not upgrade reject blocks produced under new rules, causing a chain split. Examples include the creation of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.;
Hard Money;good to go;human written;Hard money is money that resists supply expansion, often requiring significant cost to produce. Gold is historically considered hard money due to its scarcity. Bitcoin is regarded as the hardest money, since its issuance is strictly limited to 21 million coins by protocol.;
Hardware Wallet;good to go;human written;A hardware wallet is a dedicated device for storing private keys securely. It isolates signing operations from potentially compromised computers, reducing exposure to malware. Hardware wallets are commonly used for cold storage.;
HD-Wallet;good to go;human written;An HD-wallet (hierarchical deterministic wallet) is a type of Bitcoin wallet that derives all private keys, public keys, and addresses from a single master seed. Using a standardized derivation structure, it can generate a large number of addresses in different formats deterministically. HD wallets are used in most modern Bitcoin wallets, including hardware wallets, mobile wallets, and desktop wallets, to manage funds securely and efficiently.;
HODL;good to go;human written;HODL is slang originating from a misspelling of “hold,” meaning to keep bitcoin long-term regardless of price volatility. The term originated as a typo in an old Bitcoin forum by a drunk Bitcoin enthusiast who wanted to write “hold” (see [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0)). It reflects the belief that Bitcoin’s value will rise over time due to scarcity and adoption. HODLing contrasts with active trading strategies.;
Hot Wallet;good to go;human written;A hot wallet is a wallet connected to the internet, enabling quick access to funds for spending. Examples include mobile apps, browser wallets, and exchange accounts. Hot wallets are convenient but less secure than cold wallets.;
Invoice;good to go;human written;An invoice is a payment request specifying the amount, recipient, and additional details of a transaction. In the Lightning Network, invoices are a core mechanism for off-chain payments, enabling fast, low-fee transactions.;
Keynesian Economics;good to go;human written;Keynesian economics is a school of thought advocating active government intervention in the economy, particularly through fiscal and monetary policy. It contrasts with the Austrian School of Economics, which emphasizes market self-regulation. Bitcoin challenges Keynesian principles by operating outside state monetary control.;
KYC – Know Your Customer;good to go;human written;KYC refers to regulatory procedures requiring financial institutions and exchanges to verify the identity of their clients. Common steps include collecting passports, addresses, and proof of funds. KYC undermines pseudonymity in Bitcoin and creates centralized databases that may be subject to leaks and surveillance.;
Light Node;good to go;human written;A light node is a Bitcoin node that does not store the full blockchain but instead relies on Simplified Payment Verification (SPV). It downloads block headers and verifies transactions via Merkle proofs. Light nodes reduce resource requirements but depend on full nodes for validation.;
Lightning Network;good to go;human written;The Lightning Network is a second-layer payment protocol built on top of Bitcoin. It enables near-instant, low-cost off-chain transactions by using bidirectional payment channels. Security is ensured by the ability to settle disputes on the Bitcoin mainnet.;
Lightning Node;good to go;human written;A Lightning node is software that participates in the Lightning Network. It opens and maintains payment channels, routes payments across the network, and enforces channel balances using HTLCs (hashed time-locked contracts). Lightning nodes require periodic interaction with the Bitcoin blockchain for settlement.;
Mainnet;good to go;human written;Mainnet refers to the operational Bitcoin network where real Bitcoin transactions take place. It is distinguished from testnet, which is a parallel environment for experimentation without economic value. Protocol changes and software upgrades are deployed cautiously on mainnet to avoid disruption.;
Mempool;good to go;human written;The mempool (memory pool) is the collection of unconfirmed transactions stored by nodes awaiting inclusion in a block. Each node maintains its own mempool, which may differ slightly. Transaction fees largely influence how long a transaction stays in the mempool until it gets included in the next block.;
Mixer;good to go;human written;A mixer, also known as a tumbler, is a service that mixes cryptocurrency from multiple users to obscure the origin and destination of funds. By breaking the direct link between sender and recipient, mixers enhance transaction privacy and make tracing more difficult. While they can be used for legitimate privacy reasons, mixers are often associated with illicit activity and can raise regulatory and legal concerns.;
Mnemonic;good to go;human written;A mnemonic phrase (or seed phrase) is a human-readable set of words that encodes the master seed of an HD wallet. It allows the deterministic generation of all private keys, public keys, and addresses in the wallet. Seed phrases are typically 12, 18, or 24 words long and follow the BIP39 standard. They are used to back up and restore a wallet, so anyone who knows the seed phrase can access all associated funds.;
Mt. Gox;good to go;human written;Mt. Gox was a Bitcoin exchange based in Japan that operated from 2010 until its collapse in 2014. It lost approximately 850,000 BTC due to mismanagement and theft. The event remains one of the largest exchange failures in Bitcoin’s history.;
Multisig address;good to go;human written;A multisig (multi-signature) address is a Bitcoin address that requires signatures from multiple private keys to authorize spending. Instead of relying on a single private key, a multisig setup can require, for example, signatures from 2 out of 3 private keys (called 2-of-3 multisig). Multisig addresses are often used for corporate wallets, joint accounts, or escrow arrangements to reduce the risk of theft or accidental loss. (Note: even if only a subset of keys is needed to spend funds, all the public keys in the redeem script are required to reconstruct the multisig address, so backing up the full redeem script containing all public keys is important.);
Nakamoto (unit);good to go;human written;A Nakamoto is sometimes proposed as a denomination equal to 1 million bitcoin. While not a standard unit in the protocol, it reflects homage to Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin.;
NGU – Number Go Up;good to go;human written;NGU is a meme shorthand for the expectation that the price of bitcoin will continually increase over time, which by itself attract new market participants. It references Bitcoin’s programmed scarcity and the long-term adoption trend, contrasting with inflationary fiat currency.;
Nocoiner;good to go;human written;A nocoiner is slang for someone who does not own bitcoin, often dismissing or criticizing it. The term is used informally in online discourse to describe skeptics or late adopters.;
Non-Custodial Wallet;good to go;human written;A non-custodial wallet is a wallet where the user retains sole control over the private keys. Unlike a custodial wallet, it does not depend on a third party to secure funds. Non-custodial wallets embody the principle of self-sovereignty in Bitcoin.;
Off-Chain;good to go;human written;Off-chain refers to actions or transactions that occur outside the Bitcoin blockchain. Examples include bilateral agreements, Lightning Network transactions, and custodial transfers. Off-chain methods can provide scalability and privacy benefits but rely on additional trust or enforcement mechanisms.;
On-Chain;good to go;human written;On-chain refers to actions recorded directly in the Bitcoin blockchain. On-chain transactions consume block space, incur fees, and gain security from Proof-of-Work and confirmations. On-chain settlement serves as the ultimate arbiter of disputes in second-layer protocols.;
OP_RETURN;good to go;human written;OP_RETURN is a Bitcoin script opcode that allows small amounts of arbitrary data to be embedded in a transaction. Outputs using OP_RETURN are provably unspendable, meaning the bitcoin associated with them cannot be spent. A famous early example of embedded data is found in the first Bitcoin block (the genesis block), which contains the message “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,” serving as a timestamp and commentary.;
Open Source;good to go;human written;Open source refers to software whose source code is publicly available for use, modification, and distribution. Bitcoin Core, the reference client, is open source, enabling transparency and peer review. Open-source development fosters resilience and decentralization.;
Oracle;good to go;human written;An oracle is an external data source that provides real-world information to a blockchain-based system. Oracles introduce an additional form of trust into a system. Bitcoin itself minimizes reliance on oracles, but second-layer protocols may require them.;
Oracle Problem;good to go;human written;The oracle problem refers to the challenge of importing trustworthy external data into a trust-minimized system. Oracles introduce points of centralization and attack, undermining the security model of decentralized systems.;
Orphan Block;good to go;human written;An orphan block is a valid block not included in the best blockchain (meaning the version of the blockchain with the most accumulated Proof-of-Work) due to a competing block being accepted first. Orphans result from temporary forks and are eventually discarded, although the transactions within may still be confirmed in later blocks.;
P2P (Peer-to-Peer);good to go;human written;Peer-to-peer describes the network architecture in which nodes directly connect and share data without central intermediaries. Bitcoin’s P2P network propagates transactions and blocks, ensuring censorship resistance and decentralization.;
Paperwallet;good to go;human written;A paper wallet is a form of cold storage where private keys or mnemonics are printed on paper. While secure against online attacks, paper wallets risk physical damage or loss and are less practical than hardware wallets.;
Passphrase;good to go;human written;A passphrase is an optional, user-chosen secret that is combined with a wallet’s recovery seed to derive a completely separate set of keys and addresses. It acts as an additional layer of security by modifying the key derivation process. In principle, a passphrase can be any sequence of characters, including letters, numbers, symbols, or even an empty string, but it must be remembered exactly to recover the funds.;
Payment Channel;good to go;human written;A payment channel is a mechanism enabling two parties to transact off-chain while using the blockchain only for opening and closing the channel. They are the fundamental building blocks of the Lightning Network.;
Precoiner;good to go;human written;A precoiner is slang for someone who does not yet own bitcoin but is not necessarily hostile toward it. The term is often used optimistically to describe potential future adopters.;
Private Key;good to go;human written;A private key is a secret cryptographic number that allows the owner to authorize and sign Bitcoin transactions. From the private key, the corresponding public key and Bitcoin address are mathematically derived. In principle, a private key is a randomly generated 256-bit number within a defined range and must be kept secret, as anyone who knows it can spend the associated bitcoin.;
Protocol;good to go;human written;A protocol is the set of formal rules governing communication and behavior in a network. In Bitcoin, the protocol defines transaction formats, block validation, and consensus rules. Changes to the protocol require broad agreement among nodesto avoid a fork.;
Public Key;good to go;human written;A public key is the cryptographic counterpart to a private key in public key cryptography. In Bitcoin, it is derived from the private key using the elliptic curve secp256k1. Public keys are used to generate Bitcoin addresses (via hash functions like SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160) and to verify digital signatures in transactions.;
Public Key Cryptography;good to go;human written;Public key cryptography is a cryptographic system using key pairs consisting of a private key and a public key. In Bitcoin, it enables digital signatures where the private key authorizes a transaction and the public key allows others to verify authenticity. As suggested by their names, the private key should be held secret while the public key may be publicly disclosed.;
Satoshi (unit);good to go;human written;A satoshi is the smallest indivisible unit of Bitcoin, equal to 0.00000001 BTC. All balances and transactions on the protocol level are denominated in satoshis. The term honors Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.;
Second Layer;good to go;human written;A second layer is a protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain to enhance scalability or functionality. Examples include the Lightning Network and sidechains like the Liquid Network. These systems rely on Bitcoin’s on-chain settlement for security guarantees.;
Seed  Phrase;good to go;human written;A seed phrase (or mnemonic phrase) is a human-readable set of words that encodes the master seed of an HD wallet. It allows the deterministic generation of all private keys, public keys, and addresses in the wallet. Seed phrases are typically 12, 18, or 24 words long and follow the BIP39 standard. They are used to back up and restore a wallet, so anyone who knows the seed phrase can access all associated funds.;
Segwit;good to go;human written;Segregated Witness (Segwit) is a Bitcoin protocol upgrade activated in 2017 via a soft fork. It separates transaction signatures (witness data) from the main transaction structure, reducing malleability and enabling capacity increases measured in virtual bytes (vBytes). Segwit also laid the foundation for Taproot.;
Settlement;good to go;human written;Settlement refers to the final and irreversible recording of a transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain. Once confirmed by sufficient blocks, the transaction cannot be reversed without reorganizing the chain, providing strong finality compared to traditional financial systems.;
Sidechain;good to go;human written;A sidechain is a separate blockchain that can interact with a main blockchain, allowing assets to be transferred between the two while operating under different rules or features. Sidechains can enable experimentation with new functionality, faster transactions, or alternative consensus mechanisms without affecting the security or stability of the main blockchain. For Bitcoin, sidechains like Liquid are used to facilitate faster, confidential transactions and to support specialized applications while keeping the main Bitcoin network secure.;
Signature;good to go;human written;A signature is a cryptographic proof that a transaction was authorized by the holder of a specific private key. It is created using the private key and can be verified by anyone using the corresponding public key. Signatures ensure the authenticity and integrity of Bitcoin transactions without revealing the private key.;
Simplified Payment Verification (SPV);good to go;human written;Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) is a method allowing light nodes to verify transactions without downloading the full blockchain. By checking block headers and Merkle proofs, an SPV client can confirm that a transaction is included in a valid block, though it trusts that the majority of miners are following the Bitcoin consensus rules;
Soft Fork;good to go;human written;A soft fork is a backward-compatible protocol change in Bitcoin. Nodes that do not upgrade still recognize blocks as valid, though upgraded nodes enforce additional rules. Segwit and Taproot were both activated via soft forks.;
Soft Money;good to go;human written;Soft money refers to currencies that can be easily inflated or devalued by monetary authorities. It contrasts with hard money, which has strong scarcity properties. Bitcoin is often described as hard money due to its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins.;
Sound Money;good to go;human written;Sound money is a form of currency that is reliably scarce, durable, and resistant to arbitrary inflation, maintaining its value over time. The term originates from historical coins made of metal, which were considered “sound” because they could not be easily inflated or debased and produced a ringing sound when struck, which helped verify their authenticity. In the context of Bitcoin, sound money refers to the network’s fixed supply limit of 21 million coins, predictable issuance schedule, and decentralized control, which protect it from manipulation or excessive creation.;
Stable Coin;good to go;human written;A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to maintain price stability, typically by pegging to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Unlike Bitcoin, stablecoins depend on centralized issuers or collateral mechanisms. One of the most well-known stablecoins is Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged in 1:1 relation to the US dollar.;
Stacking Sats;good to go;human written;Stacking sats refers to the practice of regularly accumulating satoshis, often through dollar-cost averaging. It emphasizes long-term holding of Bitcoin regardless of short-term price volatility.;
Taproot;good to go;human written;Taproot is a major Bitcoin protocol upgrade activated in 2021 via soft fork that enhances privacy, efficiency, and flexibility of transactions. It introduces Schnorr signatures and a new output type that makes transactions with complex spending conditions, such as multisignature or smart-contract-like scripts, indistinguishable on the blockchain from simple single-signature transactions. Taproot reduces transaction size, improves scalability, and makes advanced Bitcoin scripts harder to distinguish from regular payments.;
Testnet;good to go;human written;Testnet is a parallel Bitcoin network used for development and experimentation. It uses valueless coins and has different consensus parameters from mainnet, allowing developers to test applications without economic risk.;
Timestamp;good to go;human written;A timestamp in Bitcoin records the approximate time of block creation. Each block header contains a timestamp field, which miners set within certain bounds. Timestamps anchor the blockchain to real-world chronology and contribute to the difficulty adjustment algorithm.;
Transaction Fee;good to go;human written;A transaction fee is the difference between the sum of inputs and outputs in a Bitcoin transaction and get paid to the miner of the block. Fees incentivize minersto include transactions in blocks and form the long-term security budget once the block subsidy diminishes.;
Unit of Exchange;good to go;human written;A unit of exchange is a standard measure used to facilitate the buying and selling of goods and services. It allows people to compare values, set prices, and conduct transactions efficiently without needing direct barter. Being widely accepted as a unit of exchange is an important feature of good money.;
Virtual Byte (vByte);good to go;human written;A virtual byte (vByte) is a unit used in Bitcoin to measure the effective size of a transaction for fee calculation. It was introduced with Segregated Witness (SegWit) to account for the different weighting of witness and non-witness data. One vByte corresponds to four weight units, and transaction fees are typically quoted in satoshis per vByte (sat/vB).;
Wallet;good to go;human written;A wallet is software or hardware managing private keys and facilitating Bitcoin transactions. Wallets can be custodial or non-custodial, and may take forms such as hardware wallets, mobile wallets, or paper wallets.;
Whale;good to go;human written;In the context of Bitcoin, a whale is an entity that holds a very large amount of bitcoin. Due to their large holdings, whales can potentially influence market liquidity and price in the short term.;
Whitepaper;good to go;human written;The Bitcoin white paper is the original publication, released on October 31, 2008, by Satoshi Nakamoto titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” It describes the original design, principles, and cryptographic mechanisms behind Bitcoin. The Bitcoin white paper can be found [here](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).;
XBT;good to go;human written;XBT is an alternative ticker symbol for Bitcoin, based on the ISO 4217 currency code standard. While BTC is more common, XBT is used in some financial contexts to align with formal currency naming conventions.;
Xpub – Extended Public Key;good to go;human written;An extended public key (xpub) is a component of HD-wallets that allows the derivation of all child public keys and addresses without revealing any private keys. Xpubs are often used for generating receive addresses in merchant applications.;
Zero Confirmation;good to go;human written;A zero-confirmation transaction is one that has been broadcast to the network but not yet included in a block. While visible in the mempool, it remains vulnerable to double spending until confirmed.;
Master Key;out;human written;A master key is the root key in an HD-wallet from which all other private keys, public keys, and addresses are deterministically derived. Backup of the master key or its associated mnemonic phrase is sufficient to restore the entire wallet structure.;
Ring Signature;out;AI written;A ring signature is a digital signature scheme where a message is signed by one member of a group, but the verifier cannot determine which member produced it. While not part of Bitcoin, ring signatures are used in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero to obscure transaction origins.;
51 percent attack;published;human written;A 51 percent attack occurs when a single entity controls more than half of the network’s total hash rate. This allows the attacker to create a competing blockchain that outpaces the honest chain, enabling double spending and transaction censorship. The attack does not permit creation of invalid coins or breaking of cryptography but undermines confidence in the immutability of the ledger. Today, a 51 percent attack is practically inconceivable given the immense computational power it would require to outpace Bitcoin's current hashrate.;
Ark;published;human written;The Ark protocol is a proposed second-layer solution for Bitcoin designed to enable scalable off-chain payments. It uses intermediaries called Ark Service Providers to aggregate user transfers while ultimately settling on the base layer. This design seeks to combine scalability, privacy, and reduced liquidity requirements compared to the Lightning Network.;
ASP – Ark Service Provider;published;human written;An Ark Service Provider (ASP) is a specialized participant in the proposed Ark protocol, a second-layer Bitcoin scaling solution. ASPs coordinate off-chain transaction batching and provide liquidity while users maintain self-custody of their private keys. ASPs replace the need for trusted intermediaries by relying on Bitcoin transactions and cryptographic guarantees.;002
Atomic Swap;published;human written;An atomic swap is a protocol that enables two parties to exchange assets across different blockchains without a trusted intermediary. It relies on hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs), which ensure that the transaction is completed within the set timeframe. There are two types of atomic swaps: on-chain swaps between two different cryptocurrencies on two seperate blockchains, and off-chain swaps on second-layer channels off a main blockchain, such as the Lightning Network.;002
Bitcoin Core;published;human written;Bitcoin Core is the open-source reference software implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. It provides a full node that enforces consensus rules by validating transactions and blocks. Although it is widely used, Bitcoin Core is not the only implementation of the Bitcoin protocol.;
Block;published;human written;A block is a data structure in the Bitcoin blockchain containing a set of validated transactions, a reference to the previous block’s hash, and a nonce satisfying the current difficulty target. Blocks are produced by miners via Proof-of-Work and linked together to form the immutable ledger.;
Block Fee;published;human written;A block fee is the total sum of transaction fees payed in a block. Together with the block subsidy, it constitutes the block reward received by the miner. Fees are determined by the difference between input and output values in a transaction.;
Block Hash;published;human written;A block hash is the output of applying the SHA-256 hash function twice to the block header. It uniquely identifies a block and must lie below the current difficulty target for the block to be considered valid. Because of the preimage resistance of the hash function, the only way to find a valid block hash is through brute-force computation in the Proof-of-Work process. This ensures that the Bitcoin blockchain is secured by computational power.;
Block Header;published;human written;The block header is an 80-byte metadata structure summarizing a block. It contains the previous block’s hash, the Merkle root of included transactions, the timestamp, the difficulty target, and the nonce. Miners repeatedly modify the nonce when performing Proof-of-Work.;
Block Height;published;human written;The block height is the sequential number of a block in the blockchain, starting with the genesis block at height 0. It serves as a reference point for blocks and is used to measure blockchain length. The consensus mechanism of Bitcoin ensures that the highest valid chain by accumulated work is accepted.;
Block Reward;published;human written;The block reward is the incentive given to a miner for appending a valid block to the blockchain. It consists of the block subsidy and the collected block fees. Over time, the subsidy decreases via scheduled halvings, shifting reliance to transaction fees.;
Block Subsidy;published;human written;The block subsidy is the newly issued bitcoin in each block. It began at 50 bitcoin and is reduced by half every 210,000 blocks in the halving process. Eventually, the subsidy will reach zero, leaving only transaction fees as miner incentives.;
Block Time;published;human written;The block time is the average interval between successive blocks added to the Bitcoin blockchain. The protocol targets a block time of 10 minutes by adjusting the difficulty every 2016 blocks to match the prevailing hashrate. While the expected average is 10 minutes, actual block intervals vary due to the probabilistic nature of Proof-of-Work.;
Blockchain;published;human written;A blockchain is a sequential chain of  blocks, which are cryptographically linked by blocks hashes. It serves as a public, append-only ledger of all transactions. In Bitcoin, the blockchain is secured by Proof-of-Work, making historical records computationally infeasible to alter.;
Coinbase Transaction;published;human written;A coinbase transaction is the first transaction in each block, created by the successful miner. It has no inputs and pays the block reward to the miner. The coinbase field may also include arbitrary data such as extra nonces or text messages.;
Consensus Mechanism;published;human written;A consensus mechanism is a set of rules by which distributed systems agree on a single valid state of the ledger. In Bitcoin, consensus arises from block validation rules and the rule to accept the chain with the most accumulated Proof-of-Work.;
Debt-deflation dynamic;published;human written;The debt-deflation dynamic describes a self-reinforcing cycle in which falling prices increase the real burden of outstanding debt. As prices and nominal incomes decline, the fixed nominal value of debt and interest payments becomes harder to service. This strain leads to defaults and deleveraging, reducing aggregate demand and pushing prices down further. The resulting credit contraction and bankruptcies amplify the process, creating a deflationary spiral that can destabilize the entire financial system.;004
Difficulty;published;human written;The Block difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to find a valid block hash that meets the current difficulty target. A block is only valid if its hash lies below a certain threshhold, known as the difficulty target. The difficulty target is adjusted every 2016 blocks, which correspond to approximately 2 weeks, to maintain an average block time of 10 minutes.;
Financialization;published;human written;Financialization is the process by which financial markets, instruments, and motives gain increasing influence over economic activity. The term is sometimes used to describe the development of financial capitalism from 1980 to the present, a period during which debt-to-equity ratios increased and financial services grew to account for a larger share of national income relative to other sectors. It is characterized by the expansion of leverage, derivatives, and speculative capital allocation relative to productive investment. From a Bitcoin perspective, financialization can blur the boundary between sound monetary assets and financial claims built upon them.;004
Fiscal dominance;published;human written;Fiscal dominance describes a situation in which government debt levels and budgetary needs constrain central bank policy. Under fiscal dominance, monetary authorities must prioritize financing state deficits—typically through inflationary measures—over price stability. Bitcoin is sometimes framed as an escape from the risks inherent in prolonged fiscal dominance.;004
Full Node;published;human written;A full node is software that independently validates all transactions and blocks against consensus rules. Full nodes enforce the protocol and maintain the UTXO set. Running a full node is essential for verifying Bitcoin without trusting third parties.;
Genesis Block;published;human written;The genesis block is the first block in the Bitcoin blockchain, mined by Satoshi Nakamoto on January 3, 2009. It has a block height of 0 and contains a message referencing a newspaper headline about bank bailouts. Its structure is hardcoded in every Bitcoin client.;
Halving;published;human written;A halving is the scheduled reduction of the block subsidy by 50% every 210,000 blocks, which corresponds to approximately every four years. The halvings ensure the fixed supply of about 21 million bitcoin (20,999,999.9769 BTC to be exact) that will ever exist.;
Hash Function;published;human written;A hash function is a one-way mathematical function that produces a fixed-size output from arbitrary input data. Its key properties are that different inputs produce different outputs, one cannot reproduce the input from the output, and that even tiny changes in the input completely changes the output. Bitcoin relies on SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 as its primary hash functions.;
Hashrate;published;human written;The hashrate is the total computational power applied to Proof-of-Work in the Bitcoin network. It is measured in hashes per second and determines the overall security against attacks such as a 51 percent attack. Higher hashrate increases network resilience.;
Miner;published;human written;A miner is an entity operating specialized hardware to perform Proof-of-Work. Miners assemble valid transactions into blocks and attempt to find a nonce that produces a block hash below the current difficulty target. Successful miners receive the block reward.;
Mining;published;human written;Mining is the process of producing new blocks through Proof-of-Work. It secures the blockchain by requiring real-world computational effort, thereby preventing double spending. Mining also issues new bitcoin via the block subsidy and distributes transaction fees. Today, Bitcoin mining is highly professionalized, carried out by specialized companies operating industrial-scale facilities (aka mining farms) with purpose-built ASIC hardware, optimized energy sourcing, and sophisticated operational strategies.;
Mining Farm;published;human written;A mining farm is a large-scale facility dedicated to mining. It typically hosts thousands of ASICs in a location with low-cost electricity and effective cooling. Mining farms dominate the total network hashrate due to economies of scale.;
Mining Pool;published;human written;A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their hashrate to reduce variance in rewards. The pool operator distributes block rewards proportionally to contributed work. This stands in contrast to solo mining, where an individual miner attempts to find blocks independently. Solo mining pools offer a hybrid approach: each miner submits work individually but uses shared infrastructure to reduce operational overhead while still receiving full rewards when a block is found.;
Monetary premium;published;human written;A monetary premium is the portion of an asset’s market value that exceeds its utility or intrinsic use-value, reflecting its role as money. Gold historically carried a large monetary premium due to its function as a store of value. Bitcoin’s value is similarly understood as arising primarily from its monetary properties rather than from industrial use.;004
Node;published;human written;A node is software that participates in the Bitcoin network by following consensus rules, validating transactions and blocks, and relaying information. A full node independently verifies all rules, while a light node relies on external validation.;
Nonce;published;human written;A nonce is a 32-bit field in the block header that miners vary when performing Proof-of-Work. By changing the nonce, miners attempt to find a valid hash below the difficulty target. When nonce space is exhausted, other fields such as the coinbase extra nonce are adjusted.;
Petrodollar;published;human written;The petrodollar refers to the global system in which international oil sales are predominantly denominated and settled in U.S. dollars. This arrangement, established in the 1970s, reinforced the dollar’s status as the world’s primary reserve currency. The petrodollar system creates structural demand for dollars and U.S. debt, shaping international monetary and trade dynamics.;004
Proof of Work (POW);published;human written;Proof-of-Work is Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism requiring miners to find block hashes below the current difficulty target. This secures the blockchain with verifiable computational power, preventing alteration of the transaction history. Miners receive a reward in bitcoin, known as a block reward, for providing this computing power to the network.;002
RIPEMD-160;published;human written;RIPEMD-160 is a cryptographic hash function producing a 160-bit output. Bitcoin uses RIPEMD-160 applied to a SHA-256 hash of a public key to generate addresses. This process shortens keys and adds an extra layer of security.;
Satoshi Nakamoto;published;human written;Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. He published the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008 and released the first version of the reference implementation, Bitcoin Core, in January 2009. Satoshi mined the genesis block and contributed to the early development of the protocol before disappearing in 2010. To this day, it remains unknown who Satoshi Nakamoto is and whether the name represents a single individual or a group of people.;
SHA-256;published;human written;SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function producing a 256-bit output. It is the core algorithm in Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Workand address generation. Double SHA-256 is applied to block headers to secure the blockchain.;
Solo Mining;published;human written;Solo mining is the practice of an individual miner attempting to find valid blocks independently, rather than joining a mining pool. While feasible in Bitcoin’s early days, solo mining is now highly unlikely to succeed due to the vast network hashrate.;
UTXO – Unspent Transaction Output;published;human written;An unspent transaction output (UTXO) is a chunk of bitcoin that was received in a previous transaction but has not yet been spent. An UTXO can serve as an input of a new Bitcoin transaction. Only an owner of the private key corresponding to the bitcoin address, which controls the UTXO, can spend the UTXO in a new transaction. For that reason, the complete collection of all UTXOs at any given time, known as the UTXO set, fully represents the current global state of bitcoin ownership.;002
UTXO Management;published;human written;UTXO management refers to the strategy and handling of multiple unspent transaction outputs within a wallet. Efficient UTXO management reduces transaction fees, avoids unnecessary address reuse, and minimizes privacy leaks. It also ensures that inputs are selected in a way that balances performance, cost, and long-term usability of the UTXO set.;
UTXO Set;published;human written;The UTXO set is the complete collection of all currently spendable transaction outputs in the Bitcoin system. It represents the global state of bitcoin ownership and is maintained by all full nodes.;
