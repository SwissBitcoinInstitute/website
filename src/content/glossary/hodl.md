# HODL

"HODL is slang originating from a misspelling of “hold,"" meaning to keep bitcoin long-term regardless of price volatility. The term originated as a typo in an old Bitcoin forum by a drunk Bitcoin enthusiast who wanted to write “hold"" (see [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0)). It reflects the belief that Bitcoin’s value will rise over time due to scarcity and adoption. HODLing contrasts with active trading strategies."
