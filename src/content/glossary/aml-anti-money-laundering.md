# AML – Anti-Money Laundering

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) refers to a set of laws, regulations, and procedures designed to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate. Financial institutions, including cryptocurrency exchanges, are required to implement AML measures such as customer identification, transaction monitoring, and reporting of suspicious activity. While AML frameworks aim to reduce financial crime and promote transparency, they also limit privacy and can reduce financial sovereignty for users.
