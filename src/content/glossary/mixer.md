# Mixer

A mixer, also known as a tumbler, is a service that mixes cryptocurrency from multiple users to obscure the origin and destination of funds. By breaking the direct link between sender and recipient, mixers enhance transaction privacy and make tracing more difficult. While they can be used for legitimate privacy reasons, mixers are often associated with illicit activity and can raise regulatory and legal concerns.
