# Adress

A Bitcoin address is an identifier used to receive bitcoin. It is derived from a public key, which in turn is derived from a private key. Bitcoin sent to an address can only be spent by someone who controls the corresponding private key. A wallet consists of one or more Bitcoin addresses and their associated keys. Common address formats include Base58Check (legacy), Bech32 (SegWit), and Bech32m (Taproot), each reflecting different script types.
