# Segwit

Segregated Witness (Segwit) is a Bitcoin protocol upgrade activated in 2017 via a soft fork. It separates transaction signatures (witness data) from the main transaction structure, reducing malleability and enabling capacity increases measured in virtual bytes (vBytes). Segwit also laid the foundation for Taproot.
