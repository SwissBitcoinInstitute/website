# Public Key Cryptography

Public key cryptography is a cryptographic system using key pairs consisting of a private key and a public key. In Bitcoin, it enables digital signatures where the private key authorizes a transaction and the public key allows others to verify authenticity. As suggested by their names, the private key should be held secret while the public key may be publicly disclosed.
