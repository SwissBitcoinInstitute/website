# Confirmation

A confirmation is the process by which a Bitcoin transaction is included in a block on the blockchain and recognized as valid by the network. Each additional block added on top of the block containing the transaction counts as one more confirmation, increasing the security and finality of the transaction. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it becomes to reverse, making it increasingly secure against double-spending.
