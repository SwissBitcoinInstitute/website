# Private Key

A private key is a secret cryptographic number that allows the owner to authorize and sign Bitcoin transactions. From the private key, the corresponding public key and Bitcoin address are mathematically derived. In principle, a private key is a randomly generated 256-bit number within a defined range and must be kept secret, as anyone who knows it can spend the associated bitcoin.
