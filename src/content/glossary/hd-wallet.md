# HD-Wallet

An HD-wallet (hierarchical deterministic wallet) is a type of Bitcoin wallet that derives all private keys, public keys, and addresses from a single master seed. Using a standardized derivation structure, it can generate a large number of addresses in different formats deterministically. HD wallets are used in most modern Bitcoin wallets, including hardware wallets, mobile wallets, and desktop wallets, to manage funds securely and efficiently.
