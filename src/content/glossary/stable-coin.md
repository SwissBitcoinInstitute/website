# Stable Coin

A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to maintain price stability, typically by pegging to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Unlike Bitcoin, stablecoins depend on centralized issuers or collateral mechanisms. One of the most well-known stablecoins is Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged in 1:1 relation to the US dollar.
