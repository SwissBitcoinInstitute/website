# Seed  Phrase

A seed phrase (or mnemonic phrase) is a human-readable set of words that encodes the master seed of an HD wallet. It allows the deterministic generation of all private keys, public keys, and addresses in the wallet. Seed phrases are typically 12, 18, or 24 words long and follow the BIP39 standard. They are used to back up and restore a wallet, so anyone who knows the seed phrase can access all associated funds.
