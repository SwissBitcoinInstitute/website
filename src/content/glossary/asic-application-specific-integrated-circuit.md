# ASIC – Application Specific Integrated Circuit

An ASIC is a hardware circuit built for a single computational task. In mining, ASICs are optimized exclusively for SHA-256 hashing, making them vastly more efficient than CPUs, GPUs, or FPGAs. Their introduction professionalized mining and concentrated it in industrial-scale facilities.
