# Double-Spending

The double-spending problem refers to the risk that a digital token could be spent more than once. Because digital information can be copied, preventing double-spending is a core challenge in digital money systems. Bitcoin solves this problem by recording transactions in a public blockchain secured by Proof-of-Work, making past entries computationally infeasible to reverse.
