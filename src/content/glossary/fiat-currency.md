# Fiat Currency

"A fiat currency is money issued by a state and declared legal tender, without backing by a commodity like gold or silver. Its name comes from the Latin word fiat, meaning “there shall be,"" reflecting that the currency has value because the government decrees it. Unlike Bitcoin, its supply is controlled by central banks and can be expanded arbitrarily. Examples include the US dollar, euro, and yen."
