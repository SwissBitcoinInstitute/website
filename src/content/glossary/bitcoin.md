# Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency and peer-to-peer payment network secured by Proof-of-Work. It records transactions in a public blockchain, maintained by independently validating nodes. Bitcoin has a fixed monetary supply of 21 million coins, enforced by consensus rules. Its design eliminates the need for intermediaries, combining digital scarcity with censorship resistance and global accessibility.
