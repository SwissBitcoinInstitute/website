# Fractional Reserve Banking

Fractional reserve banking is a banking system in which banks keep only a fraction of customer deposits as reserves and lend out the remainder. This practice allows banks to create money through lending, increasing the effective money supply in the economy. Fractional reserve banking is the dominant banking model in most modern economies today. Associated risks of fractional reserved banking are increased leverage, systemic fragility, and the potential for bank runs if confidence is lost.
