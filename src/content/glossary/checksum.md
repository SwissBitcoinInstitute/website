# Checksum

A checksum is a short sequence of bits added to data to detect errors or alterations. It is derived from the original data using a cryptographic hash function and appended so that any change in the data, such as a mistyped character in a Bitcoin address or seed phrase, will result in an invalid checksum. This allows software to immediately detect mistakes or tampering, preventing Bitcoin from being sent to an incorrect or non-existent address.
