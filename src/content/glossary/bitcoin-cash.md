# Bitcoin Cash

Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that originated from a hard fork of Bitcoin in August 2017. The fork was driven by disagreements within the Bitcoin community over scalability, particularly whether to increase the block size to allow more transactions per block (this debate is known as the Blocksize War). Bitcoin Cash increased the block size limit to prioritize on-chain transaction throughput, resulting in a separate blockchain and cryptocurrency distinct from Bitcoin. Today, Bitcoin Cash is significantly smaller in terms of network security, adoption, and economic activity and is largely irrelevant in size compared to Bitcoin.
