# Passphrase

A passphrase is an optional, user-chosen secret that is combined with a wallet’s recovery seed to derive a completely separate set of keys and addresses. It acts as an additional layer of security by modifying the key derivation process. In principle, a passphrase can be any sequence of characters, including letters, numbers, symbols, or even an empty string, but it must be remembered exactly to recover the funds.
