# Mempool

The mempool (memory pool) is the collection of unconfirmed transactions stored by nodes awaiting inclusion in a block. Each node maintains its own mempool, which may differ slightly. Transaction fees largely influence how long a transaction stays in the mempool until it gets included in the next block.
