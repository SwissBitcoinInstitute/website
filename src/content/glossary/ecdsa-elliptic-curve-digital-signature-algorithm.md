# ECDSA – Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm

ECDSA is a cryptographic algorithm used in Bitcoin to create digital signatures. It allows a user to prove ownership of a private key by generating a signature that can be verified with the corresponding public key, without revealing the private key itself. Bitcoin uses the secp256k1 elliptic curve for ECDSA.
