# Virtual Byte (vByte)

A virtual byte (vByte) is a unit used in Bitcoin to measure the effective size of a transaction for fee calculation. It was introduced with Segregated Witness (SegWit) to account for the different weighting of witness and non-witness data. One vByte corresponds to four weight units, and transaction fees are typically quoted in satoshis per vByte (sat/vB).
