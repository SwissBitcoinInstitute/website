# Orphan Block

An orphan block is a valid block not included in the best blockchain (meaning the version of the blockchain with the most accumulated Proof-of-Work) due to a competing block being accepted first. Orphans result from temporary forks and are eventually discarded, although the transactions within may still be confirmed in later blocks.
