# Blocksize War

The Blocksize War refers to the prolonged debate and conflict within the Bitcoin community, roughly between 2015 and 2017, over how to scale the Bitcoin network. The core disagreement centered on whether to increase the block size limit to allow more on-chain transactions or to prioritize decentralization and implement scaling solutions such as Segregated Witness (SegWit) and second-layer protocols. The conflict resulted in deep community divisions and ultimately led to hard forks such as Bitcoin Cash, while Bitcoin retained smaller blocks and adopted off-chain scaling approaches.
