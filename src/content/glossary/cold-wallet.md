# Cold Wallet

A cold wallet is a storage method where private keys are kept offline, disconnected from the internet. Examples include hardware wallets, paper wallets, and air-gapped devices. Cold wallets reduce exposure to online attacks and are suitable for long-term storage of significant amounts of bitcoin.
