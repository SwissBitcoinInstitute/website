# Sidechain

A sidechain is a separate blockchain that can interact with a main blockchain, allowing assets to be transferred between the two while operating under different rules or features. Sidechains can enable experimentation with new functionality, faster transactions, or alternative consensus mechanisms without affecting the security or stability of the main blockchain. For Bitcoin, sidechains like Liquid are used to facilitate faster, confidential transactions and to support specialized applications while keeping the main Bitcoin network secure.
