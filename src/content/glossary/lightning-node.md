# Lightning Node

A Lightning node is software that participates in the Lightning Network. It opens and maintains payment channels, routes payments across the network, and enforces channel balances using HTLCs (hashed time-locked contracts). Lightning nodes require periodic interaction with the Bitcoin blockchain for settlement.
